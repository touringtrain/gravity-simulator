# gravity-simulator

##### This project is from VG101 in SJTU-JI, and the skeleton is written by the teaching assistants of this course.

To run the code, download the code under the same MATLAB directory, run main.m, enter the number of balls, and press "Enter". The code would randomly 
generate balls with different sizes according to your input number, and perform the movement of the balls under the simulated gravity.
